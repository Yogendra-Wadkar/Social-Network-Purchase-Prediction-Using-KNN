# Social Network Purchase Prediction

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Social Network Purchase Prediction project, where we employ the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict user purchases in a social network. This project involves comprehensive data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

## Key Features

1. **KNN Algorithm:** The project leverages the KNN algorithm to predict user purchases based on demographic features such as gender, age, and estimated salary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Thorough exploration and analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, check for outliers, and gain insights into the data's characteristics.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Techniques such as outlier detection using the interquartile range (IQR), label encoding for the 'Gender' column, and scaling using `StandardScaler` to prepare the data for model training.

4. **Model Training:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the KNN algorithm is applied to create a demo model and a final model with optimal hyperparameters.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation of the models, including accuracy assessment, the application of the elbow method for optimal k value determination, and visualization of results.
